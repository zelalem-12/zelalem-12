This is my roadmap to deepen my expertise as a **Senior Golang Backend Engineer**, focusing on:

- ⚡ Fintech systems (payments, ledgers, reconciliation)
- 🔐 Identity & Access Management (OIDC, OAuth2, SAML)
- 🌐 Web3 & Decentralised Identity (DID, VC, smart contracts)
- 🧱 Scalable backend systems (Hexagonal, CQRS, DDD)

## 🗺️ Roadmap Overview

### ✅ 1. Go Mastery & Clean Architecture

- [ ] Advanced Go patterns: interfaces, generics, functional options
- [ ] Build testable services with **Hexagonal Architecture**
- [ ] Implement CQRS + Event Sourcing with `go-eventually`
- [ ] Benchmarking, fuzzing, goroutine safety, and profiling

### 💳 2. Fintech Engineering

- [ ] Simulate card issuing, 3DS, transaction flows
- [ ] Implement maker-checker flows for a banking portal
- [ ] Write a reconciliation engine for bank APIs
- [ ] Integrate a multi-provider bill aggregator

🔗 _Resources_:
- [Stripe Docs](https://stripe.com/docs)
- [Adyen Dev Blog](https://www.adyen.com/blog)

🧪 _Project Ideas_:
- `bank-sim`: Fake core banking API with issuing and settlement
- `billpay-aggregator`: Aggregator for real-time utility payments

---

### 🛡️ 3. Identity & Access Management (IAM)

- [ ] Build a compliant Identity Provider (OIDC + SAML + OAuth2)
- [ ] Add token revocation, introspection, and refresh support
- [ ] Integrate with Keycloak, Okta, Azure AD
- [ ] Support RBAC, ABAC, and SCIM provisioning

🔗 _Resources_:
- [OAuth2 in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/oauth-2-in-action)
- [OpenID Connect Spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)

🧪 _Project Ideas_:
- `getchkd-idp`: Modular Go-based IdP with JWT + SAML tokens
- `oidc-tester`: OIDC RP simulator for protocol validation

---

### 🪙 4. Web3 & Decentralized Identity

- [ ] Learn DIDs & Verifiable Credentials (W3C Spec)
- [ ] Write smart contracts (Solidity + Fabric chaincode)
- [ ] Build Ethereum sign-in flow (EIP-4361)
- [ ] Implement DID Resolver microservice in Go

🔗 _Resources_:
- [W3C DID Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
- [EIP-4361: Sign-In with Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361)

🧪 _Project Ideas_:
- `did-resolver`: DID resolution service over REST
- `web3-login`: Ethereum login demo with backend signature verification
- `identity-ledger`: Blockchain-based event logger (Hyperledger Fabric)

---

### 📦 5. Distributed Systems & Observability

- [ ] Set up OpenTelemetry tracing + metrics
- [ ] Use Kafka + outbox for async events
- [ ] Add support for JWT replay protection (JTI store)
- [ ] Use Vault or AWS KMS for key management

🔗 _Resources_:
- [Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/)
- [OpenTelemetry Docs](https://opentelemetry.io/)

🧪 _Project Ideas_:
- `traceable-idp`: OIDC/SAML system with OpenTelemetry tracing
- `secure-token-service`: JWT-based token server with Vault-backed keys

---

## 🧠 Stretch Goals

- [ ] Publish a Web3 Identity SaaS MVP (targeting emerging markets)
- [ ] Contribute to Ory, Keycloak, or Hyperledger projects
- [ ] Launch a blog on identity protocols and backend architecture
- [ ] Certify in Kubernetes (CKA), Solidity, or IAM security
