## 🚀 What I Do

- Design and implement **fintech platforms** — from **digital wallets** to **banking portals** with maker-checker workflows
- Build **event-driven microservices** using **gRPC**, **Kafka**, and **PostgreSQL**
- Apply modern backend patterns like **CQRS**, **DDD**, and **hexagonal architecture**
- Develop **API-first services** with **secure OAuth2/JWT authentication**
- Containerize and orchestrate deployments with **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and sometimes **Kubernetes**
